# MTH9815_Files
Files for the MTH 9815 course, software engineering.

This is the quiz1 files from Chengxun (James) Wu.

The bonus "remove" function was not finished, but I hope to get some partial points for the trials! :-)

Edit: I just found out that my version of "remove" fail for visual studio debug mode, but it WORKS fine in the release mode, as well as in g++.

To run the testcases, use g++: g++ -o quiz1.exe main.cpp

Please comment out the part of remove in my "main.cpp" to see the functionality of the remove function!
